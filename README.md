# graphite-nagios #

A simple nagios alerter that alerts from graphite data.  It's odd in that
it uses an embedded lisp so as to be scriptable.  Perhaps in retrospect
this should have been plain old python modules.

Oh well.  It was more an exercise in playing with lisp than it was
a real thing.

Do not recommend.
